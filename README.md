# Credit-Card-Attrition-Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer attrition within a bank’s credit card portfolio using advanced statistical and machine learning methods. The goal is to identify the key predictors of churn and to develop a predictive model that can help in formulating effective customer retention strategies.

## Methods Used

	•	Binary Logit
	•	CART (Classification and Regression Trees)
	•	Random Forest
	•	XGBoost

## Results

The CART model demonstrated the best overall performance with an accuracy of 94.07% and high sensitivity, proving to be the most effective at identifying potential customer churn. This model now aids in targeted decision-making for customer retention efforts.
